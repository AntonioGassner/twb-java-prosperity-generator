# twb-java-prosperity-generator

to run this program just download the Main.java class and open it in an IDE like IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code, then click the green arrow to run, or however you run code in your IDE of choice. 

I commented the most relevant stuff since it is a very basic program, just to help you make the use you want for it. 
Have fun
